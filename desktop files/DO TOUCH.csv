		Xiao Yan!<br>
		<br>
		It&rsquo;s great to hear from you! I love Florida because the weather is wonderful! I also love the English Program here. But it is really hard. I am studying English literature at the university. I think you should try an intensive English program. In an intensive program, you study English to get better at reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Intensive programs are usually only for a short time. You should check out the intensive English program at my university. Here is the link to their website: <a>www.intensiveenglishFL.com.</a> It would be fun for you to come to Florida!<br>
		<br>
		Best wishes,<br>

		Hi Benny,<br>

		Thanks for the information about your school. I think an intensive English program is what I need. I will look into the one at your school. I would love to live close to you. But then you would have to put up with me all the time!<br>
		<br>
		Thanks again,<br>

		It&rsquo;s great to hear from you! I love Florida because the weather is wonderful! I also love the English Program here. But it is really hard. I am studying English literature at the university. I think you should try an intensive English program. In an intensive program, you study English to get better at reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Intensive programs are usually only for a short time. You should check out the intensive English program at my university. Here is the link to their website: <a>www.intensiveenglishFL.com.</a> It would be fun for you to come to Florida!<br>

		Dear Parents,<br>
		I am so excited to be working with your brilliant children this year! For our social studies lessons, we will be learning about world geography. Throughout the year, we will study different countries from each continent. Next semester, I will assign each student a specific country for a final project. I will send another letter about that project later on.<br>
		For now, I actually need to enlist your help! Each time we study a new continent or region, I want to invite a guest presenter to come in. This will make the lessons more entertaining and fun for the students. I am looking for presenters who are from or have lived in a foreign country. If you or someone you know has experience with one of the following regions and can do a presentation, please contact me!<br>
		<br>
		Central America<br>
		South America<br>
		Western Europe<br>
		Eastern Europe<br>
		Western and Southern Africa<br>
		Northern Africa and the Middle East<br>
		Eastern Asia<br>
		Central Asia<br>
		Australia and the Pacific<br>
		<br>
		I am including a map of the countries in each region, but please let me know if you have any questions! The presentations will last for about an hour. You can discuss the history, the culture, the food, and your own experiences there. Please bring souvenirs or other objects to enrich your lesson if possible. We would love to try some typical food from each region as well!<br>

		Hi Maria!<br>
		I just wanted to write and thank you for bringing that salad to the picnic on Saturday. It was so delicious! Also, I'm so glad your family could come to the picnic. My boys had so much fun playing with your sons. I didn't know they had so many similar interests! We should get them together. Maybe on Tuesdays we can take them to play soccer at the park? Are you guys free on Tuesdays?<br>
		Love,<br>

		Hi Adrienne!<br>
		I'm so glad you liked the salad. I can give you the recipe if you want. And I agree about Saturday. That picnic was so much fun! Can you believe Angela Wilson grilled all those hamburgers and hot dogs by herself? She's amazing. Sam and Charlie would love to play soccer with your boys on Tuesdays. Should we go to Long Bridge Park, where the picnic was? And what time? We're free whenever.<br>
		Have a great day!<br>
		Maria<br>
		______________________________________________________________________<br>
		<br>
		2:37pm<br>
		Hi again Maria!<br>
		I would love the recipe! I think that salad was better than any dessert I've ever had. Did it have sugar in it? Actually, let's take the boys to Ellis Park by the lake. How about we meet at 10am? It gets so hot in the afternoon, and Lincoln needs to take his nap at 1pm.<br>
		Adrienne<br>
		_____________________________________________________________________<br>
		<br>
		9:31pm<br>
		Hey Adrienne,<br>
		I'm attaching the recipe to this email. It's from a magazine article I found online. There's actually no sugar in it-- it's honey. See you on Tuesday!<br>

Hi Maria! 
I just wanted to write and thank you for bringing that salad to the picnic on Saturday. It was so delicious! Also, I'm so glad your family could come to the picnic. My boys had so much fun playing with your sons. I didn't know they had so many similar interests! We should get them together. Maybe on Tuesdays we can take them to play soccer at the park? Are you guys free on Tuesdays? 
Love, 
Adrienne

		Hi Adrienne!<br>
		I'm so glad you liked the salad. I can give you the recipe if you want. And I agree about Saturday. That picnic was so much fun! Can you believe Angela Wilson grilled all those hamburgers and hot dogs by herself? She's amazing. Sam and Charlie would love to play soccer with your boys on Tuesdays. Should we go to Long Bridge Park, where the picnic was? And what time? We're free whenever.<br>

		Hi again Maria!<br>
		I would love the recipe! I think that salad was better than any dessert I've ever had. Did it have sugar in it? Actually, let's take the boys to Ellis Park by the lake. How about we meet at 10am? It gets so hot in the afternoon, and Lincoln needs to take his nap at 1pm.<br>

		<p>Q&amp;A: questions and Answers<br>
		This month&rsquo;s question comes from Joel. He lives in San Francisco, California.<br>
		<br>
		&ldquo;My parents say I should choose my friends with caution. But I know I shouldn&rsquo;t judge others. So, I need some advice. I want to choose good friends. But at the same time, I don&rsquo;t want to judge people too harshly. It&rsquo;s tough to do that. What can I do?&rdquo;<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Our answer:</strong> Joel, we&rsquo;ve got some tips for you. First of all, show respect and kindness to everybody. This isn&rsquo;t the same as having a close friendship with everyone. In other words, be cautious. Follow your parents&rsquo; advice. Choose your close friends carefully. Your close friends will influence your life a lot. How can you know if a person will be a good friend? Ask yourself two questions. Do you make good choices in that person&rsquo;s company? Will he or she always be there for you?<br>
