Trello Grabber

Ask Ben Fryar (fryarb@byui.edu) for details about the project.

If you need to create a new trello-grabber file, copy it from "VBA Solution Template (WORKING)." Don't ever make changes to an original file in this repo, copy the file first then make your changes. This is, unfortunately, the only good way to deal with this project.
